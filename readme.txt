- `git clone https://github.com/10up/block-catalog.git && cd block-catalog`
- `composer install && npm install && npm run build`

 2. Activate Plugin 

== Getting Started ==

On activation, the plugin will prompt you to index your content. You need to do this first before you will be able to see the various blocks used on your site. You can also go to *WP-Admin > Tools > Block Catalog* to do this yourself.

Alternately, you can run the WP CLI command `wp block-catalog index` to index your content from the command line.

Once indexed, you will be able to see the different blocks used on your site in the Block Catalog Taxonomy.

Navigating to an Block Editor post type will also show you the list of blocks present in a post.

You can also filter the listing to only show Posts that have a specific block.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1) Why does the Plugin require indexing? =

Block Catalog uses a taxonomy to store the data about blocks used across a site. The plugin can build this index via the Tools > Block Catalog screen or via the WP CLI `wp block-catalog index`. After the initial index, the data is automatically kept in sync after any content updates.

= 2) Why does the name displayed in the plugin use the blockName attribute instead of the title? =

If your blocks are registered on the Backend with the old [register_block_type](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_type/) API, you may be missing the `title` attribute. The newer [register_block_type_from_metadata](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_type_from_metadata/) uses the same `block.json` on the FE and BE which includes the Block title.

When the plugin detects such a missing `title`, it uses the `blockName` suffix instead. eg:- xyz/custom-block will display as Custom Block.

To address this you need to update your custom block registration. If this is outside your control, you can also use the `block_catalog_block_title` filter hook to override the title as seen below.

<pre><?php

add_filter( 'block_catalog_block_title', function( $title, $block_name, $block ) {
	$map = [
		"xyz/custom-block" => "My Custom Block",
	];

	if ( ! empty( $map[ $block_name ] ) ) {
		return $map[ $block_name ];
	}

	return $title;
}, 10, 3 );
</pre>
